## Project Summary:
MediTrack is designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of managing hospital inventory
and equipment. By leveraging real-world data combined with synthesized datasets, the system
aims to provide a robust and comprehensive solution for healthcare providers.
<br>
<br>
This innovative system employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft a dynamic and
user-friendly frontend interface. The frontend design ensures an intuitive and engaging
experience for users, facilitating seamless interactions with the platform.
<br>
<br>
On the backend, MediTrack utilizes the powerful Django framework, providing a solid foundation
for robust and scalable functionality. The data is stored and managed efficiently using
MongoDB, a NoSQL database that accommodates the dynamic nature of healthcare data.
<br> <br>
For the deployment phase, the project team is currently considering utilizing either Amazon Web
Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Both cloud providers offer a suite of services
suitable for hosting Django applications and MongoDB databases. The choice between AWS
and GCP will be made based on factors such as scalability, cost-effectiveness, integration
capabilities, and the specific requirements of the project.

## Project Description:
1. Objectives:
- To develop a comprehensive system for tracking, managing, and analyzing hospital
equipment and inventory.
- To analyze historical usage data to identify patterns and trends in equipment usage,
helping to inform decisions about procurement, allocation, and resource planning.
- To provide a real-time view of inventory levels and equipment status via a dynamic and
responsive monitoring system.
- To aid in decision-making processes related to equipment procurement and resource
allocation, and provide insights for the next best action.
- To explore the possibility of using data analysis to optimize inventory levels for different
equipment and supplies, considering factors like demand variation and storage costs.
While this presents potential for future business development, its current implementation
remains uncertain.
<br><br>
2. Usefulness:
- Hybrid Data Approach: MediTrack stands out due to its hybrid data approach, using both
real-world and synthesized datasets to create a more versatile and testable system.
- Target Audience: The system targets hospital administrators and supply chain
managers, aiming to minimize equipment downtime and optimize inventory levels.
- Data-Driven Predictive Approach: MediTrack differs from existing solutions by providing
a more data-driven, predictive approach to inventory and equipment management.
- Intuitive Visualizations: MediTrack enhances user experience by incorporating intuitive
visualizations. The system generates graphical representations of inventory trends,
equipment statuses, and predictive analytics, making complex data more accessible and
facilitating quick decision-making.
<br><br>
3. Dataset:
- The dataset will be a combination of real-world data sourced from credible healthcare
databases and synthesized data to fill gaps and create more comprehensive scenarios.
- Approximately 20,000 + real-world records from sources like Data.gov and the CDC,
supplemented with synthesized records to create a robust dataset of around 30,000+
medical equipment records.[Link]
- At the moment, we are considering which columns to include. We are leaning towards
incorporating the ID, type, status, and purchase date.
<br><br>
4. Sharing:
- The project's repository on GitHub [link] will be updated regularly with code,
documentation, and synthesized datasets.
- we will use Google Docs linked to our project page for collaborative documentation and
progress tracking.[Link]
