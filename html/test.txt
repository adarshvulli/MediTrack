Thinning of some parallax effect website / glass morphism UI  – cause found a tutorial for that
One page is for the form where we enter details 
Option  – to upload the excel sheet of data so the database gets updated.
One page is to view the database – (this will have the update and delete option)
Then we have a visualization page
